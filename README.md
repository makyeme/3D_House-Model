## General Information

In this project,  geospatial data provided by an industrial player was used to develop a 3D Model of a house.
The 3D model is generated and plotted by inputting a simple home address. 
The output of this project will be crucial in aiding the company launch its new branch in the insurance business.



## Technology

This project was created with:

* Anaconda virtual environment(Geodata)  version: 4.9.2
* anaconda-navigator version: 1.10.0
* Python version: 3.8.5
* Jupyter notebook version: 6.2.0
* Numpy library version: 1.19.2
* Requests version: 2.25.1
* Matplotlib library version: 3.3.4
* Rasterio library version: 1.9.0
* Json5 library version: 0.9.5
* Geopandas library version: 0.8.1
* Pandas library version: 1.2.1
* gdal library version: 3.0.2
* Plotly Library version: 4.14.3



## Setup

#### 1. Exploring the raster Images

- In this code segment, I explore the Digtal Surface Model(dsm) and the Digtal Terrain Model(dtm).
- Useful information on the raster images is generated, such as :

    - Image bounds, 
    - Coordinate refrence system (crs)
    - Displaying image array
    - Images of the untransformed and transformed rasters are displayed
    - Libraries used: numpy, matplotlib, gdal, rasterio

#### 2. Obtaining the Canopy Hieght Model (chm)

    - Under this code segment, the chm is generated by subtracting dtm array from the dsm array
    - A 2D plot of the chm is generated for visual exploration
    - The created raster of the chm is exported to a target local directory
    - Libraries used: numpy, matplotlib, gdal, rasterio

#### 3. Generating polygon of input home address
- Under this code segment:
    - From the API: basisregisters.vlaanderen.be
    - I use the requests & Json libraries to obtain polygon coordinates of input home address 
    - The polygon request is executed in three steps
    - The generated polygon shapefile is exported to target directory
    - Libraries used: requests, json, geopandas

#### 4. Plotting the polygon of input home address
    - Libraries used: requests, json, geopandas, matplotlib

#### 5. Musking and clipping chm raster using polygon of home address
   - In this code segment, I generate a clipped raster of the chm
   - and store it in a target directory
   - Libraries used: rasterio

#### 6. Generating 3D plot of the input home address
  - In this code segment, 3D plots of home adress are generated
  - First I use the matplotlib library (several formarts of plots are displayed)
  - Then I use the Plotly library 


## Status

#### Realised 
* Obtained a 3D model of a house with only an input home address
* Better visualization 

#### Pending
* ‘Good to have features’ which incorporate house area(m²), number of rooms, surrounding features etc.
* Rapid return of search results 
* Formulating a generic code that accomodates and generates a 3D plot for a random input home address
* Conecting the code segments to generate one automated code which triggers a 3D plot from input home address
