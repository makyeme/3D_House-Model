## General Information

In this project,  geospatial data provided by an industrial player was used to develop a 3D Model of a house. 
starting from a given home address. 
This information will be will be crucial in aiding the company to launch a new branch in the insurance business.


## Technology

This project was created with:

*Anaconda virtual environment(Geodata)  version: 4.9.2
*anaconda-navigator version: 1.10.0
*Python version: 3.8.5
*Jupyter notebook version: 6.2.0
*Numpy library version: 1.19.2
*Requests version: 2.25.1
*Matplotlib library version: 3.3.4
*Rasterio library version: 1.9.0
*Json5 library version: 0.9.5
*Geopandas library version: 0.8.1
*Pandas library version: 1.2.1
*gdal library version: 3.0.2


## Setup

### Rasterio & Gdal
*Open, read, write and export Geotiff images (DSM, DTM & CHM)
*Geo-transform geotiff images 
*Obtain CHM from the DSM & DTM 

### Numpy
*Manipulate image arrays to obtain image bounding boxes & plotting

### Requests & Json
*Extract coordinate & polygon data of input home address from relevant APIs

### Geopandas
*Import, open and manipulate shapefiles (polygons)

### Matplotlib
*Plot 2D and 3D graphs
*Generate an interactive back end interface to visualize, rotate and manipulate graphs


## Status

### Realised 
*Obtained the ‘Must have version’: A 3D model of a house with only an input home address
*Better visualization 

### Pending
*‘Good to have features’ which incorporate house area(m²), number of rooms, surrounding features etc.
*Rapid return of search results
